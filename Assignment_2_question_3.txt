Question 3

Q3: Discuss the time complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations in a basic queue.
How can you optimize these operations for specific use cases?

Solution:

The time complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations in a basic queue depends on the implementation of the queue.

 If the queue is implemented using an array, the time complexity of both operations is O(1) .
 If the queue is implemented using a linked list, the time complexity of both operations is O(1) as well .
To optimize these operations for specific use cases, you can use a circular queue. A circular queue is a
variation of a queue data structure in which the last element is connected to the first element to make a circle.
 This makes it possible to use the spaces that are left empty after a dequeue operation. In a circular queue,
 the enqueue and dequeue operations can be performed in O(1) time complexity .
Another way to optimize these operations is to use a priority queue. A priority queue is a type of queue in
 which each element is assigned a priority and is dequeued based on its priority. The elements with higher
 priority are dequeued first. The time complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations in a priority queue depends
 on the implementation of the priority queue. If the priority queue is implemented using a heap, the time complexity
 of both operations is O(log n).
In conclusion, the time complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations in a basic queue is O(1) for both array and
linked list implementations. To optimize these operations for specific use cases, you can use a circular queue or
a priority queue.
