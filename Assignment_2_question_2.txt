Q2: In what scenarios would you choose a linked list implementation
over an array implementation for a queue, and vice versa?

The choice between a linked list implementation and an array implementation for a queue
depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the application. here are some
 considerations for choosing between the two:
 **Linked List Implementation for a Queue:**
  1. **Dynamic Size:
  ** If the size of the queue is expected to change frequently, a linked list
  implementation is often more suitable. Linked lists can easily accommodate dynamic
   resizing without the need to preallocate a fixed amount of memory.
    2. **Frequent Insertions and Deletions:
    ** Linked lists excel at constant-time insertions and deletions at both ends.
    If your application involves frequent enqueueing and dequeueing operations,
     a linked list may be a more efficient choice than an array.
      3. **No Fixed Size:
      ** Linked lists allow for a more flexible size management. You can allocate
      memory as needed, avoiding the need to define a fixed size in advance.

      **Array Implementation for a Queue:
      ** 1. **Random Access:
      ** If your application requires random access to elements or if you frequently
       need to access elements at specific positions, an array implementation might be
        more appropriate. arrays provide constant-time access to elements based on the
        ir indices.
         2. **Memory Efficiency:
         ** Arrays can be more memory-efficient than linked lists due to lower overhead per element.
          Linked lists require additional memory for the pointers linking nodes, while arrays only store the actual data.
          3. **Sequential Access Patterns:
          ** If the queue operations are primarily sequential (enqueue at the rear, dequeue at the front), and random
           access is not a crucial factor, an array-based implementation can be simpler and more efficient.
           In summary, choose a linked list implementation for dynamic sizing, frequent insertions/deletions, and
            flexibility in memory allocation. Opt for an array implementation for scenarios requiring random access,
             memory efficiency, and when the queue operations are primarily sequential. The specific requirements and
              usage patterns of the application should guide the choice between the two implementations.
